#
# ADDING A RECORDING: add one "tape:output" line to DEMOS below and drop the
# matching assets/<tape>.tape beside it. Encoding, syncing and the orphan and
# staleness checks all derive from that line.
#
# WHY BOTH FORMATS, since they look redundant and are not:
#
#   GIF  the README. GitHub strips <video> from markdown, and its auto-embedded
#        player needs a file uploaded through the web UI to `user-attachments`,
#        which no script can regenerate.
#   MP4  the landing page. These three were 5.5 MB of GIF in three <img>s;
#        as H.264 they are about 1.7 MB, which is most of the page weight. Each
#        tape emits it alongside its GIF, from the same render, so the two
#        cannot disagree and there is no transcode step to forget.
#
# The GIFs stay in web/public too, as the <video> fallback. If that fallback is
# ever judged not worth its deploy size, delete the copies AND the nested <img>
# in web/src/pages/index.astro — one without the other is what actually breaks.
