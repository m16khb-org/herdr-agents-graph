//! A scripted mouse pointer, for recordings only.
//!
//! VHS (which records the demo GIFs) is keyboard-only, and it films a headless
//! terminal where no OS pointer exists to film. So zoetrope's mouse-driven
//! features — drag-to-pan, wheel-zoom around the cursor, and dragging the
//! scrubber to seek — cannot be captured directly at all. The keyboard demo in
//! `assets/demo.tape` shows everything reachable by key; this closes the rest.
//!
//! The app owns every cell of the frame, so it can move a pointer and draw one.
//! An autopilot runs a script of waypoints, synthesizes real
//! [`crossterm::event::Event::Mouse`] events, and paints a cursor glyph where
//! that pointer is.
//!
//! **The events are the point.** The synthesized events go through
//! [`crate::handler::handle_event`], the same entry the real terminal uses — so
//! the scrubber-row intercept, the flow's hit testing, and the drag threshold
//! all run for real. Animating the camera or the playhead directly would look
//! superficially similar and demonstrate nothing.
//!
//! Demo scaffolding, gated by the caller behind `ZOETROPE_DEMO=1`. Nothing here
//! runs for a real user.
